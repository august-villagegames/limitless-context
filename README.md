# Offline LLM Bundle Capture Project

Planning artifacts for the macOS offline capture pipeline. Implementation work has not started yet; review the documents below for detailed scope and design.

- `docs/SPEC.md` – Product goals, functional requirements, acceptance criteria.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` – Architecture, capture subsystems, data flow.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` – Phase-based roadmap and milestones.
- `docs/TASK_LOG.md` – Chronological log of project planning tasks.

Next step: stand up the Go module and CLI skeleton as outlined in the roadmap before tackling capture subsystems.
