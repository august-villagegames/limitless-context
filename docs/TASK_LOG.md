# Task Log

## 2024-05-13
- Initialized project planning artifacts in `docs/`.
- Authored product spec capturing objectives, workflows, acceptance criteria.
- Drafted technical design outlining architecture, capture subsystems, and validation flow.
- Created roadmap with phase-by-phase milestones and success checklist.
- Documented implementation decisions: vendored go-macscreenrec screen recorder, auto-detect optional Whisper/Tesseract with graceful fallbacks.

## 2024-05-14
- Reviewed planning artifacts and confirmed product spec, design, and success criteria are finalized for Phase 0 kickoff.
- Selected Go 1.21 toolchain, enumerated core libraries (Cobra CLI, Zerolog logging), and documented vendoring strategy for required capture dependencies.
- Defined optional dependency handling for Whisper.cpp ASR and Tesseract OCR with runtime detection, offline guidance, and manifest reporting.

## 2024-05-15
- Established repository scaffold with `cmd/`, `internal/`, and `pkg/` directories aligned to the technical design.
- Initialized Go module `github.com/offlinefirst/limitless-context` and added placeholder CLI dispatcher with roadmap-aligned subcommands.
- Authored bootstrap-oriented `Makefile` targets (tidy, vendor, build, lint, test) to anchor future tooling automation.

## 2024-05-16
- Delivered Phase 1 config loader with offline-friendly YAML subset parser and validation.
- Wrapped Go's `slog` for structured logging with CLI-configurable level and format overrides.
- Upgraded CLI dispatcher to handle global flags, per-command options, and context-aware stubs; documented updates in README and design.
- Built run manifest module that provisions timestamped run directories, writes schema-versioned metadata, and prepares per-subsystem folders for capture assets.

## 2024-05-17
- Implemented event tap stub with dual-granularity JSON outputs, configurable redaction patterns, and unit coverage.
- Added screenshot trigger scheduler with throttling, placeholder artifact generation, and tests.
- Created video recorder stub and capture orchestrator that drive all subsystems from `tester run` and summarise outputs.
- Expanded configuration schema, CLI run flow, and documentation to mark Phase 1 capture foundations complete.

## 2024-05-18
- Delivered Phase 2 capture upgrades: ASR meeting detection with Whisper gating and OCR worker with Tesseract detection.
- Extended privacy controls with app/URL allow-lists, filtered event metrics, and shared redaction across subsystems.
- Introduced capture controller supporting pause/resume/kill coordination and covered behaviour with unit tests.
- Updated CLI summaries, manifests, configuration schema, and documentation to reflect enhanced capture outputs.

## 2024-05-19
- Added configurable capture duration with countdown logging and graceful shutdown via controller timer.
- Enriched run manifests with lifecycle timestamps, termination reasons, and persisted them from `tester run`.
- Surfaced lifecycle summary in CLI output and updated roadmap milestone for Phase 2.5 duration work.

## 2024-05-20
- Captured per-subsystem availability and outcome summaries in the capture orchestrator, manifest, and CLI output to support Phase 2.5 diagnostics work.
- Added environment probing for the video subsystem to document the current ScreenCaptureKit stub fallback and surfaced messaging for downstream tooling.
- Completed the remaining Phase 2.5 integration stories with concurrent subsystem orchestration, permission-aware environment probing for screenshots/events/video, and manifest/CLI reporting for controller state transitions.
- Documented macOS permission flows, smoke test guidance, and roadmap updates to mark Phase 2.5 milestones complete.

## 2024-05-21
- Verified macOS build prerequisites, signing identity guidance, and binary output location to support the ScreenCaptureKit workflow.
- Added Hardened Runtime entitlements file covering Screen Recording and audio input permissions and documented validation steps.
- Exercised the CGO-enabled `make macos-build` target, codesign commands (including entitlement verification), and first-run prompt workflow; logged completion in Phase 2.6 roadmap milestones.
