# Task Log

## 2024-05-13
- Initialized project planning artifacts in `docs/`.
- Authored product spec capturing objectives, workflows, acceptance criteria.
- Drafted technical design outlining architecture, capture subsystems, and validation flow.
- Created roadmap with phase-by-phase milestones and success checklist.
- Documented implementation decisions: vendored go-macscreenrec screen recorder, auto-detect optional Whisper/Tesseract with graceful fallbacks.

## 2024-05-14
- Reviewed planning artifacts and confirmed product spec, design, and success criteria are finalized for Phase 0 kickoff.
- Selected Go 1.21 toolchain, enumerated core libraries (Cobra CLI, Zerolog logging), and documented vendoring strategy for required capture dependencies.
- Defined optional dependency handling for Whisper.cpp ASR and Tesseract OCR with runtime detection, offline guidance, and manifest reporting.

## 2024-05-15
- Established repository scaffold with `cmd/`, `internal/`, and `pkg/` directories aligned to the technical design.
- Initialized Go module `github.com/offlinefirst/limitless-context` and added placeholder CLI dispatcher with roadmap-aligned subcommands.
- Authored bootstrap-oriented `Makefile` targets (tidy, vendor, build, lint, test) to anchor future tooling automation.

## 2024-05-16
- Delivered Phase 1 config loader with offline-friendly YAML subset parser and validation.
- Wrapped Go's `slog` for structured logging with CLI-configurable level and format overrides.
- Upgraded CLI dispatcher to handle global flags, per-command options, and context-aware stubs; documented updates in README and design.
- Built run manifest module that provisions timestamped run directories, writes schema-versioned metadata, and prepares per-subsystem folders for capture assets.

## 2024-05-17
- Implemented event tap stub with dual-granularity JSON outputs, configurable redaction patterns, and unit coverage.
- Added screenshot trigger scheduler with throttling, placeholder artifact generation, and tests.
- Created video recorder stub and capture orchestrator that drive all subsystems from `tester run` and summarise outputs.
- Expanded configuration schema, CLI run flow, and documentation to mark Phase 1 capture foundations complete.

## 2024-05-18
- Delivered Phase 2 capture upgrades: ASR meeting detection with Whisper gating and OCR worker with Tesseract detection.
- Extended privacy controls with app/URL allow-lists, filtered event metrics, and shared redaction across subsystems.
- Introduced capture controller supporting pause/resume/kill coordination and covered behaviour with unit tests.
- Updated CLI summaries, manifests, configuration schema, and documentation to reflect enhanced capture outputs.
